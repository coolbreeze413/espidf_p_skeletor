(1) WiFi does not work (STA cannot connect to router)

wifi may not work because of nvs_open failing. this can happen if the nvs partition got truncated.
This will cause error traces (usually enabled by default in the config) such as:
        
        W (84) wifi: wifi nvs_open fail ret=4353

        E (84) wifi: wifi_init 1410 ret=4353
        [E][WiFiGeneric.cpp:120] wifiLowLevelInit(): esp_wifi_init 4353
        W (87) wifi: wifi nvs_open fail ret=4353

to fix the nvs partition, we need to erase the flash, there is a make target for that:
"make erase_flash"
and then retry "make flash"
if the nvs corruption was the problem, this will fix it.
Also, nvs_flash_init() is required in main() -> check that the return value is ESP_OK.
This will immediately point to the nvs problem, if it exists.


(2) nvs_flash_init FAILED! error code = [0x105]
this means that the nvs partition was not found !
the nvs partition label must be "nvs" ! (alongwith type: data, subtype: nvs)
